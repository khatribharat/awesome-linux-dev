## Mailing Lists

* [LKML (Linux Kernel Mailing List)](http://vger.kernel.org/lkml/) - This is the official mailing list for Linux kernel development where the majority of the announcements, discussions, debates, and flame wars over the kernel take place.

## Books

The goal of this book is to provide enough information on the design and implementation of the Linux kernel that a sufficiently accomplished programmer can begin developing code in the kernel.

## Wikis

* [Kernel.org Wiki](https://www.wiki.kernel.org/) - This is the official wiki for Linux kernel development.
* [TLDP (The Linux Documentation Project)](http://en.tldp.org/) - LDP is a loosely knit team of volunteers who provide documentation for many aspects of Linux.
* [Linux Kernel Newbies](https://kernelnewbies.org) - Kernel newbies is a community of aspiring Linux kernel developers who work to improve their kernels and more experienced developers willing to share their knowledge.
* [Linux Documentation](https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/) - The new Sphinx documentation for Linux kernel (generated from source tree) hosted by Intel.

## Blogs

* [Kernel Planet](http://planet.kernel.org/) - This site is an aggregation of blogs from several kernel hackers, part of kernel.org.

## Websites

* [LWN (Linux Weekly News)](https://lwn.net) - Started in 1998, this is the most popular and trusted source to follow developments in the Linux community.
* [Kernel Release Timeline Predictions](http://phb-crystal-ball.org/) - Get unofficial predictions on kernel release timeline based on historical data. Source available [here](http://phb-crystal-ball.org/source.txt).
* [Linux Weather Forecast](https://www.linux.com/news/linux-weather-forecast) - This page is an attempt to track ongoing developments in the Linux development community that have a good chance of appearing in a mainline kernel and/or major distributions sometime in the near future.
* [Weekly roundup of LKML](https://lkml.wtf/) - Started by [Jessie Frazelle](https://twitter.com/jessfraz), this is a rather interesting and witty weekly roundup of announcments on LKML.

## Source-based Linux Distributions

* [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) - Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code.
* [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org) - Gentoo can become an ideal secure server, development workstation, professional desktop, gaming system, embedded solution or something elseâ€”whatever you need it to be. Because of its near-unlimited adaptability, Gentoo folks call Gentoo a metadistribution.

## Advanced User Space Projects

* [Wine Developer's Guide](https://wiki.winehq.org/Wine_Developer%27s_Guide) - Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, & BSD.

## Lego-build Your Own OS

* [Genode](https://genode.org/about/index) - The Genode OS Framework is a tool kit for building highly secure special-purpose operating systems. It scales from embedded systems with as little as 4 MB of memory to highly dynamic general-purpose workloads.

## Write Your Own OS

* [os01 - Operating Systems: From 0 to 1](https://tuhdo.github.io/os01/) - Bootstrap yourself to write an OS from scratch. A book for self-learner.
* [The Little Book About OS Development](https://littleosbook.github.io/) - This text is a practical guide to writing your own x86 operating system. It is designed to give enough help with the technical details while at the same time not reveal too much with samples and code excerpts.
* [OSDev Wiki](http://wiki.osdev.org/) - A hobby OSDev community, probably the largest online community of operating system developers.

## Me-too Lists

* [Hacker Docs](http://www.dit.upm.es/~jmseyas/linux/kernel/hackers-docs.html)
